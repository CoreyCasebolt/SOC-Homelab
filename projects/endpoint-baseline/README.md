# 🖥️ Endpoint Baseline Documentation

## 🎯 Purpose

Before deploying monitoring agents or generating attack traffic, I documented the clean baseline state of internal endpoints within my SOC homelab.

Establishing a known-good baseline allows for:

- Comparing pre- and post-agent system state
- Identifying changes introduced by monitoring tools
- Understanding normal operating behavior
- Supporting structured detection engineering
- Providing evidence of clean environment configuration

This step mirrors real-world SOC practice where baseline system states are documented before introducing telemetry collection or security tooling.

# Corey Casebolt – Cybersecurity / SOC Portfolio

Welcome to my cybersecurity portfolio.

This repository documents hands-on projects built in my SOC homelab environment, focused on developing practical skills in security monitoring, detection engineering, investigation, and troubleshooting.

All work is performed in a controlled lab and documented with configuration details, validation steps, screenshots, and investigation notes to reflect real-world SOC workflows.

## 🏗️ Lab Architecture

![SOC Homelab Topology](projects/architecture/pfsense-homelab/screenshots/Topology.png)
This segmented environment supports attack simulation, traffic monitoring, endpoint logging, and SIEM-based detection testing.
---

## 🛡️ Core Focus Areas

- SIEM deployment and log analysis  
- Alert triage and threshold-based detection  
- Host and network-based monitoring  
- Firewall, DNS, and traffic inspection  
- Adversary simulation and validation  
- Structured troubleshooting and documentation  

---

## 🧪 Lab Structure

Projects are organized by functional area to reflect how a real SOC environment is built and validated:

- **Architecture** – Network design and environment setup  
- **Endpoints** – System configuration and log generation  
- **NSM / IDS** – Network security monitoring and intrusion detection  
- **SIEM** – Log ingestion, detection logic, and alert configuration  

Each section builds on the previous one, progressing from environment setup to detection and alert validation.

## 🔐 Featured Project – pfSense SOC Homelab (Foundational)

**Objective:**  
Establish a segmented lab environment to support monitoring, log generation, and detection testing.

**Key Concepts:**

- WAN / LAN / DMZ segmentation  
- Firewall rule configuration  
- Outbound NAT  
- DHCP and DNS resolver setup  
- Connectivity validation  
- Controlled log generation for SIEM ingestion

## 🔍 Documentation Approach

Each project includes:

- A clear objective  
- Implementation steps  
- Validation screenshots  
- Investigation notes  
- Troubleshooting breakdown (when applicable)  

The goal is not only to configure tools, but to understand how security events are generated, observed, and investigated.

- Security monitoring  
- Event analysis  
- Detection validation  
- Incident investigation  

Certifications:
- CompTIA Network+
- CompTIA Security+

> This portfolio emphasizes practical understanding over theory.  
> Every lab is built to answer the question:  
> **“What would a SOC analyst see, investigate, and validate?”**

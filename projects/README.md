# Projects – SOC Homelab

This directory contains hands-on cybersecurity projects developed in my SOC homelab.

The focus of these projects is to build practical experience in:

- Monitoring and log analysis  
- Detection engineering  
- Network security validation  
- Endpoint visibility  
- Troubleshooting and documentation  

Each subdirectory represents a different component of my lab environment and learning progression.

## Structure

### `architecture/`
Lab design, network layout, and environment documentation.

### `endpoints/`
Endpoint configuration, validation, and log generation.

### `nsm-ids/`
Network security monitoring and intrusion detection work.

### `siem/`
SIEM deployments, log ingestion validation, detection projects, and alert configuration.

These projects are part of my structured path toward developing SOC and defensive security skills through hands-on implementation and documentation.

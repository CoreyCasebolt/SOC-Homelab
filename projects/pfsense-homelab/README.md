# :closed_lock_with_key: pfSense SOC Homelab 

## Purpose
This project establishes a segmented firewall environment to support SOC-style monitoring, traffic analysis, and incident investigation.

## Overview
The lab uses pfSense to separate WAN, LAN, and DMZ networks, generating realistic firewall, DNS, and traffic logs for security analysis.

## Status
✔ Environment built  
✔ LAN connectivity verified  
✔ Internet access and DNS resolution confirmed  

Further detection and logging projects will build on this baseline.

# Security Onion Baseline

## Purpose

This documents the initial setup state of Security Onion before doing any alert tuning or traffic simulations.

I wanted to confirm everything was running properly before moving into detection and investigation work.

---

## What Was Verified

- Web interface is accessible
- Services are running (`so-status`)
- Suricata and Zeek are active
- Management and monitoring interfaces are configured

---

## Notes

Some default alerts were already visible from normal network traffic.  
No tuning or rule changes have been made yet.

---

## Screenshots Included

- SOC dashboard
- Alerts page
- Service status output
- Monitoring interface confirmation

This serves as the baseline before I begin deeper IDS and investigation projects.

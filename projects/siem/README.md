# SIEM Projects – SOC Homelab

This directory contains Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) implementations developed in my SOC homelab.

The purpose of this section is to:

- Deploy and validate SIEM platforms
- Ingest and analyze security logs
- Build and test detection logic
- Configure alerting workflows
- Document troubleshooting and lessons learned

Each subdirectory represents hands-on work focused on understanding how security events are collected, processed, and monitored in a defensive security environment.
